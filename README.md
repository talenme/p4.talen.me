P4 - Final Project
Greg Misicko - December 2013

Background -
I've been studying Russian for the past several years. I can speak and understand it on a basic level, but would not be considered fluent. I hire a language tutor to work with me on reading and grammar. Whenever we work on reading, I have to learn a lot of new vocabulary. When we work on conversation and grammar its the same thing - I have to learn a lot of new words in order to be able to speak on whatever the topic is. I have tried using actual cards for flash cards, but those are very inconvenient. I've tried software flash cards, but never found one that works well.
